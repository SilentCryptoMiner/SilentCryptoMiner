* Injection (Silent/Hidden) - Hide miner behind another process like explorer.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe and others
* Idle Mining - Can be configured to mine at different CPU and GPU usages or not at all while computer is or isn't in use
* Stealth - Pauses the miner and clears the GPU memory while any of the programs in the "Stealth Targets" option are open
* Watchdog - Monitors the miner file and replaces the file if removed and starts it if the injected miner is closed down
* Multiple Miners - Can create multiple miners to run at the same time, for example one XMR (CPU) miner and one ETH (GPU) miner
* CPU & GPU Mining - Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD)
* Bypass Windows Defender - Can add exclusions into Windows Defender to avoid being detected
* Process Killer - Constantly checks for any programs in the "Kill Targets" list and kills them if found
* Remote Configuration - Can get the miner settings remotely from a specified URL every 100 minutes
* Web Panel Support - Has support for monitoring and configuring all the miners efficiently in an online web panel
